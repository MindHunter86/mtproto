# Contributing to MTProto

based on [Xelaj styleguides](https://github.com/xelaj/birch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**english** [русский](https://github.com/xelaj/mtproto/blob/main/docs/ru_RU/CONTRIBUTING.md)

🌚🌚 First of all, thanks for your helping! 🌝🌝

This page briefly describes the process of developing both the specific MTProto package and all Xelaj projects. if you read all these rules, you will be the best helper in the westland!

## Code of conduct

We all want to make other people happy! We believe that you are a good guy, but please, just in case, read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/xelaj/mtproto/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). They will help you understand what ideals we adhere to, among other things, you will be even more cool!

By joining our community, you automatically agree to our rules _(even if you have not read them!)_. and if you saw their violation somewhere, write to rcooper.xelaj@protnmail.com, we will help!

## I don't want to read anything, I have a question!

> **Just remind:** you just don’t need to ask anything right to the issues, okay? just not necessary. you will quickly solve your problem if you find the answer below

We have the official Xelaj chat in Telegram: [@xelaj_developers](http://t.me/xelaj_developers). In this chat you can promptly clarify the information of interest to you.

Also, github create discussions page! Ask in discussions, that's why this feature released. It's like stack overflow for **any** repo like this one!

And we also actually want to do [FAQ](https://github.com/xelaj/mtproto/discussions/categories/q-a), but we don’t know what questions to write there, so, if you are reading this, probably write while in the Telegram, we'll figure it out :)

## What do I need to know before I can help?

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## And how can I help?

### For example, report a bug.

#### before reporting a bug:

* Look for issues with a bug / bug label, it is likely that it has already been reported.
* **even if you found issue**: describe your situation in the comments of issue, attach logs, backup database, just do not duplicate issues.

### You can still offer a new feature:

We love to add new features! Use the New Feature issues template and fill in all the fields. Attaching labels is also very important!

### and you can immediately offer a pull request!

Here it is up to you, the only thing is: we are more willing to take pull requests based on a specific issue (i.e., created pull request based on issue #100500 or something like this) This will help us understand what problem your request solves.

### What if you know some languages? 🤔

> [!NOTE]
> The localization for documentation currently is not accepting, however, we want to continue this practice. See explaination in the spoiler.
> <details>
>  <summary>Why we did that:</summary>
> We are working hard on adding localization features to applications and
> services, however, the process of translating documentation is stopped for
> now. The reason for the delete previous translations is very simple: we do not
> have a suitable system to keep translations up to date for markdown files.
>
> The reason lies in the fact that markdown is very difficult to structure, and
> the documentation is updated very often. The previous pipeline was like this:
> 1. the document is updated in English
> 2. the required block is manually found, using diff to send for translation
> 3. a separate (!!) pull request is created to update the translations
> 4. PR with translation is merged into PR with comments
> 5. and only after that everything is merged into the master.
>
> We are pleased with the idea that documentation can be manually translated and
> be more useful than auto-translation, but we do not yet have a suitable tool
> that would allow 1) structuring markdown files to clearly understand the
> differences between versions of translations, 2) working with git 3) work with
> github 4) don't be a pain in the ass.
>
> **If you know the tool which will help us — please, let us know. 🙏**

## Styleguide

### commit comments

* do not write what commits do (❌ — `commit adds ...` ✅ — `added support ...`)
* do not write **who** made a commit (❌ — `I changed ...` ❌ — `our team worked for a long time and created ...`)
* write briefly (no more than 60 characters), everything else - in the description after two (2) new lines
* pour all your misery into the commit description, not the comment (❌ — `fool, forgot to delete ...` ✅ — `removed ...`)
